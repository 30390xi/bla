# Apple PropertyList & .NET Managed Assembly Defense

## 1. Apple `.plist` Internal Subset Budget Trap (`src/shields/formats/apple-plist.ts`)

In `morluto/rea/src/artifacts/apple/PropertyListDecodeBudget.ts:80`:
```ts
if (token.doctype) {
  if (token.internalSubset)
    throw fail("expansion", `XML plist internal entity expansion exceeds ${budget}`);
}
```
REA rejects any XML `.plist` whose `<!DOCTYPE plist ...>` tag contains a `[` bracket (`internalSubset = true`), even when the internal subset `[]` is completely empty and defines zero XML entities!

`protectAppleXmlPlist` injects `<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd" []>`, which is 100% valid XML 1.0 for Apple's `PropertyListSerialization` while causing REA's `preflightPropertyListDecode` to immediately abort.

## 2. .NET Managed Metadata Representation Amplification (`src/shields/formats/dotnet-managed.ts`)

In `morluto/rea/src/dotnet/ManagedDecodeBudget.ts`, every metadata table row reserves `256` bytes and every UTF-8 string reserves `encodedBytes * 6 + 2` bytes against a 64 MiB ceiling, while `managed-pinvoke-import` entries trigger mandatory native ABI reconstruction obligations.
